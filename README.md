# ZID Service App

This repository contains the code for a Flutter application used to manage service requests for ZID residential complexes. The project is structured using a simple cleanâ€‘architecture approach and relies on Firebase for authentication and data storage.

## Folder Structure

```
lib/
  core/               # routing and localization helpers
  features/
    auth/             # login and user management
    home/             # role specific home pages
    requests/         # request creation and listing
    notifications/    # news and notifications
    settings/         # settings screens
    staff_management/ # admin specific tools
  models/             # plain data models
```

## Firebase

The app uses the following Firebase packages:

- `firebase_core`
- `firebase_auth`
- `cloud_firestore`
- `firebase_storage`

Ensure Firebase is initialized before running the app. Authentication is handled through `AuthService` which reads the user document from Firestore to determine the role (admin, staff or resident).

## Running

Install Flutter and run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

`main.dart` starts the app, initializes Firebase and displays the login screen. Based on the user role different home screens are shown with access to requests, notifications and settings.
